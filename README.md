# TRTC Call UIKit

This template is designed to help users quickly deploy and experience high-quality online meetings. In actual application scenarios, whether it is a friendly chat between friends thousands of miles apart, or private communication between business partners, using this template, you can easily initiate a video chat with others and enjoy a clear and smooth communication experience like face-to-face communication.

In addition, by reading this document, you will learn how to quickly run the TUIRoomKit sample project and perform secondary development. It only takes 5 minutes to successfully run the Demo and quickly build your own innovative applications such as stranger chat.

## Quick Deployment
Using the EdgeOne page, you can achieve zero-code audio and video conference system setup through rapid template deployment.

You can click the "View Demo" button on the left to experience the online demonstration.

Please note that the deployment template is based on secondary development of the original repository code, mainly for experiencing quick deployment features and online Demo. If you need to develop more extensive features, we recommend using the original repository code for in-depth development. Original development repository address: [https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUICallKit/tree/main/Web/basic-vue3](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUIRoomKit/tree/main/Web/example/vite-vue3-ts)

The following tutorial will provide detailed guidance on how to quickly run and experience the Demo.

>! This component uses two basic PaaS services of Tencent Cloud: [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047). When you activate TRTC, IM will be activated automatically. For information about the billing of IM, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

### Step 2: Download the source code and configure the project
1. Clone or download the source code in our repository (**You can start the repository to save it**).
